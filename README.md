> **🎯 Core Philosophy** — ZERO1 is designed to **generate the highest possible trading volume** while keeping your wallet at **Break-Even**. Farm rebates and rewards by producing massive volume, without losing capital.

> [!NOTE]
> **Ready out-of-the-box** — ZeroOne works immediately with its default configuration, no changes needed. However, we recommend customizing the parameters in `config/default.toml` to match your personal risk tolerance, capital, and farming goals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For **optimal performance**, run ZeroOne on an **AWS Tokyo (ap-northeast-1)** VPS. See the [VPS Setup Guide](docs/VPS_GUIDE.md).

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Step 1 — Install dependencies

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/holocron-tech/zeroone.git && cd zeroone

# Run the one-click Windows installer
setup.bat
```

---

### Step 2 — Add your Private Key 🔑

> [!CAUTION]
> **This step is mandatory.** The bot cannot sign transactions without your private key.
> Never share this file with anyone, and never commit it to Git.

A template file **`id.json.example`** is already included in the project.

**Steps:**
1. Copy `id.json.example` → rename the copy to **`id.json`**
2. Open `id.json` and replace the placeholder with your **Base58 private key**
3. Save. Done ✅

```json
{
  "PRIVATE_KEY": "5Jkm3xyzABCDEFGHIJKLMN..."
}
```

Place **`id.json`** in the root folder of the project (same folder as `setup.bat`):

```
zeroone/
├── id.json       ← ✅ HERE
├── setup.bat
├── config/
└── src/
```

**How to get your Base58 private key:**

| Wallet | Steps |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Phantom** | Settings → Security & Privacy → **Export Private Key** → copy the string |
| **Solflare** | Settings → Export Wallet → **Private Key** → copy the string |
| **01 Exchange** | Use the private key of the keypair linked to your account |

> [!TIP]
> Use a **dedicated trading wallet** with only the capital you intend to use — not your main wallet.

---

### Step 3 — Launch the bot

Simply run the **Desktop Launcher GUI**:

```bash
# Recommended on Windows:
launcher.bat

# Or using Python:
python launcher.py
```

*(If you received the compiled version, simply double-click `ZeroOne.exe`).*

1. Paste your **Private Key** (Mandatory for Real Trading — you can skip this *only* if you already created `id.json`)
2. Select the coins you want to trade (minimum 1, limited by your capital)
3. Click **START BOT** and monitor your profit from the **LIVE MONITOR** tab!

## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

ZERO1 is a fully automated **Market Making** bot. It continuously places buy and sell orders around the current market price, collecting the spread on every fill — like a mini exchange desk running 24/7 on your wallet.

### How It Works — Step by Step

**Step 1 — Data Collection**
Every second, ZERO1 pulls live market data from **Binance Futures** — the most liquid crypto exchange in the world. This includes candlestick data (OHLCV), real-time Open Interest, Volume Delta, and funding rates. Binance is used as the data source (not for trading) because its price discovery is the most accurate in the market.

**Step 2 — Signal Intelligence**
The bot runs a multi-layer signal pipeline on every new candle:
- **RSI** — detects overbought/oversold conditions to avoid buying tops or selling bottoms
- **ADX + DI** — measures trend strength; the bot switches between range and trend mode automatically
- **VWAP Distance** — filters out signals when price is too far from fair value
- **Open Interest Bias** — detects whether large players are accumulating long or short positions
- **Liquidity Heatmap** — identifies price levels with high order concentration to place smarter quotes

**Step 3 — Grid Generation**
Based on the signal score, the bot generates a **multi-level grid** of buy and sell orders around the current price. The grid spacing is dynamic — wider during high volatility (ATR-based), tighter during calm markets. This ensures the bot always quotes competitively without taking excessive risk.

```
|——— spread ———|——— spread ———|——— spread ———|——— spread ———|
  BUY $99,920   BUY $99,960   FAIR $100,000  SELL $100,040  SELL $100,080
```

**Step 4 — Risk Management**
Before any order is placed, the Risk Engine validates:
- Position size is within capital limits (`max_position_pct`)
- Daily drawdown has not exceeded the safety threshold (`max_daily_drawdown_pct`)
- Inventory is not too skewed in one direction (auto-rebalancing via `inventory_skew_factor`)
- Volatility is not spiking (automatic pause via `volatility_pause_mult`)

**Step 5 — Execution on 01 Exchange**
Orders are placed on **01 Exchange** as **Maker orders** — meaning the bot adds liquidity to the orderbook and pays zero or negative fees (rebates). Every time a buy and sell order both fill, the bot captures the spread as profit. The session is shared across all coins via a single authenticated client to avoid signature conflicts.

**Step 6 — Continuous Monitoring**
The bot monitors every fill in real-time, updates the equity curve, tracks volume generated per coin, and pushes all data to the live dashboard. If the daily loss limit is hit, the bot halts automatically and cancels all open orders.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All settings live in **`config/default.toml`**:

### Strategy Presets

| Preset | `spread_bps` | `fixed_tp_bps` | Best For |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 🛡️ **Safe Growth** | `15` | `5` | Capital growth & steady profit |
| 🚀 **Standard Farming** | `8` | `3` | Maximum volume & rebates |

### Key Parameters

```toml
[general]
capital = 100.0           # USD starting capital
paper_mode = true         # Set to false for real trading

[market_maker]
spread_bps = 8            # Distance from mid-price (basis points)
fixed_tp_bps = 3          # Take-profit target per trade
order_size_pct = 10.0     # % of capital per order
stop_loss_bps = 35        # Hard stop distance

[risk]
max_daily_drawdown_pct = 5.0   # Bot halts if daily loss > 5%
```

---

## 🪙 Coin Selection

Edit the `symbols` list in `config/default.toml`:

```toml
[markets]
symbols = ["HYPEUSD", "SUIUSD", "BERAUSD"]
```

Or select coins from the **Launcher GUI** — no file editing needed.

| Capital | Coins | Examples |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **$50 – $200** | 2 – 4 | HYPE, SUI, BERA |
| **$200 – $1K** | 5 – 8 | + APT, AAVE, XRP |
| **$1K+** | 10+ | Full coverage |

> [!TIP]
> Fewer coins = bigger orders per pair = better fill rate.

## ⚙️ Multi-Coin Configuration (Pro Mode)

The bot now supports granular per-coin configurations to avoid session conflicts and allow different strategies per market.

### 1. Active Markets (`config/active.toml`)
Define which coins to trade and their relative capital allocation:
```toml
[active]
SOLUSD = 0.5
BTCUSD = 0.5
```

### 2. Per-Coin Overrides (`config/coins/`)
Create a `.toml` file named after the symbol (e.g., `config/coins/SOLUSD.toml`) to override global settings:
```toml
[market_maker]
spread_bps = 15.0
inventory_skew_factor = 0.8

[risk]
max_position_pct = 10.0
```

### 3. Shared Session Logic
The bot uses a single authenticated session across all coins via a shared `O1Client` with an `asyncio.Lock`. This eliminates `SIGNATURE_VERIFICATION` errors caused by session overwrites.

## 📈 Dynamic Sizing
Order sizes are now calculated dynamically based on:
- **Real-time Balance**: Fetched from the exchange (non-paper mode).
- **Signal Strength**: Weights from ADX/RSI signals are applied to reduce exposure in unfavorable market regimes.
